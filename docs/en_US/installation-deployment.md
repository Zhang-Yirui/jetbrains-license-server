# Installation and Deployment Guide

This document provides a detailed guide for installing and deploying the JetBrains License Server Help project, including pre-installation preparations, project acquisition, building, and various deployment methods.

## 1. Pre-Installation Preparation

Before starting the installation and deployment, please ensure you have completed the following preparations:

### 1.1 Environment Check

Please confirm that your system meets the following environmental requirements (for detailed configuration, please refer to the [Environment Configuration Guide](./environment-configuration.md)):

- ✅ JDK 17 or above installed and configured
- ✅ Maven 3.6 or above installed and configured
- ✅ Git (optional, for cloning project code)
- ✅ Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- ✅ Sufficient disk space (recommended 1 GB or more)
- ✅ Stable network connection

### 1.2 Port Preparation

Ensure that the ports required by the project are not occupied:

| Port | Purpose | Default Value |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 10768 | License server port | 10768 |

You can change the port by modifying the `server.port` configuration item in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file.

## 2. Obtain Project Code

### 2.1 Clone Code from GitHub

Use Git to clone the project code to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blduu/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help.git
cd Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help
```

### 2.2 Download Release Package

If you don't want to clone the entire project, you can directly download the latest release package from the GitHub Releases page:

1. Visit the project's GitHub Releases page
2. Download the latest version of `Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help.jar` file

## 3. Build the Project

If you cloned the code from GitHub, you need to build the project first to generate the executable JAR file.

### 3.1 Compile the Project

Execute the following command to compile the project:

```bash
mvn compile
```

### 3.2 Run Tests

Optional step, execute test cases:

```bash
mvn test
```

### 3.3 Package the Project

Execute the following command to package the project and generate the executable JAR file:

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
```

After packaging is complete, the executable JAR file will be generated in the `target` directory with a filename format of `Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar`.

## 4. Deployment Methods

### 4.1 Run JAR File Directly

The simplest deployment method is to directly run the generated JAR file.

#### 4.1.1 Basic Run

```bash
java -jar target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar
```

Or use the downloaded release package:

```bash
java -jar Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help.jar
```

#### 4.1.2 Run with Custom Configuration

You can customize the configuration through command line parameters or environment variables:

```bash
# Use command line parameters to specify port
java -jar target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar --server.port=8080

# Use environment variables to specify configuration
SERVER_PORT=8080 java -jar target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar
```

#### 4.1.3 Run in Background

**Linux/macOS Systems:**

```bash
nohup java -jar target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar > server.log 2>&1 &
```

**Windows Systems:**

Use the `start` command to run in the background:

```cmd
start /B java -jar target\Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar > server.log 2>&1
```

### 4.2 Deploy with Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can deploy the project using containerization.

#### 4.2.1 Create Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root directory:

```dockerfile
# Use OpenJDK 17 as base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy JAR file to working directory
COPY target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-<version>.jar app.jar

# Expose port
EXPOSE 10768

# Run application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

#### 4.2.2 Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t jetbrains-license-server-helper .
```

#### 4.2.3 Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 10768:10768 --name license-server jetbrains-license-server-helper
```

#### 4.2.4 Mount External Configuration

If you need to persist data or use external configuration files, you can mount volumes:

```bash
docker run -d -p 10768:10768 \
  -v ./external:/app/external \
  -v ./application.yml:/app/application.yml \
  --name license-server jetbrains-license-server-helper
```

### 4.3 Deploy with Docker Compose

Using Docker Compose can make containerized deployment more convenient.

#### 4.3.1 Create docker-compose.yml

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  license-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "10768:10768"
    volumes:
      - ./external:/app/external
    restart: always
    environment:
      - SERVER_PORT=10768
      - SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=Jetbrains-License-Server-Helper
```

#### 4.3.2 Build and Start Service

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 4.3.3 Stop Service

```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### 4.3.4 View Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 5. Verify Deployment Results

### 5.1 Check Service Status

After deployment is complete, you can check if the service is running normally through the following methods:

#### 5.1.1 Check Process Status

**Linux/macOS Systems:**

```bash
ps aux | grep Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help
```

**Windows Systems:**

```cmd
tasklist | findstr java
```

#### 5.1.2 Test API Interface

Use `curl` or a browser to access the following URL to test if the service responds normally:

```bash
# Test license server status
curl http://localhost:10768/rpc/ping.action

# Test web management interface
curl http://localhost:10768/
```

If the service is running normally, you will receive the corresponding XML response or HTML content.

#### 5.1.3 View Logs

**Run JAR file directly:**

View console output or the specified log file (such as `server.log`).

**Docker container:**

```bash
docker logs -f license-server
```

**Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 6. Configure Firewall/Security Group

### 6.1 Linux Systems (Using iptables)

```bash
# Allow TCP connections on port 10768
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10768 -j ACCEPT

# Save rules
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

### 6.2 Windows Systems (Using Firewall)

1. Open "Control Panel" → "System and Security" → "Windows Defender Firewall"
2. Click "Advanced Settings"
3. Click "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule"
4. Select "Port" → "Next"
5. Select "TCP" → enter "10768" as the specific local port → "Next"
6. Select "Allow the connection" → "Next"
7. Select application scenarios (Domain, Private, Public) → "Next"
8. Enter rule name (such as "JetBrains License Server") → "Finish"

### 6.3 Cloud Server Security Group

If you deploy the project on a cloud server, you need to open port 10768 in the security group:

1. Log in to the cloud service provider console
2. Find the corresponding security group configuration
3. Add inbound rules to allow TCP protocol access on port 10768
4. Save configuration

## 7. Automated Deployment

### 7.1 Deploy with Shell Script

Create a deployment script `deploy.sh` to automate the deployment process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Deployment script

# Project version
VERSION="1.0.0"

# Stop old service
pkill -f "Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help"

# Clean up old files
rm -rf target/

# Pull latest code
git pull

# Build project
mvn package -DskipTests

# Start service
nohup java -jar target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-${VERSION}.jar > server.log 2>&1 &

echo "Deployment completed!"
echo "Service started, log file: server.log"
```

Add execution permission and run:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### 7.2 Use CI/CD Tools

You can use CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. to achieve automated build and deployment.

#### 7.2.1 GitHub Actions Example

Create the following configuration in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy JetBrains License Server Help

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'adopt'
        cache: maven
    
    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn -B package --file pom.xml
    
    - name: Deploy to server
      uses: easingthemes/ssh-deploy@v2
      with:
        SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        REMOTE_HOST: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
        REMOTE_USER: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
        TARGET: /opt/jetbrains-license-server
        SOURCE: target/Jetbrains-LicenseServer-Help-*.jar
```

## 8. Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

### 8.1 Port Already in Use

**Problem**: Port already in use error when starting service

**Solution**:

1. Check port usage:
   - Linux/macOS: `lsof -i :10768`
   - Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :10768`

2. Terminate the process occupying the port or modify the configuration file to use another port:
   ```bash
   # Modify configuration file
   sed -i 's/server.port: 10768/server.port: 8080/' src/main/resources/application.yml
   ```

### 8.2 Maven Build Failure

**Problem**: Build failure when executing `mvn package`

**Solution**:

1. Check if the network connection is normal
2. Clean Maven cache:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install -U
   ```
3. Check if the pom.xml file has errors
4. Try using a domestic Maven mirror:
   ```bash
   mvn package -Dmaven.repo.local=/path/to/local/repo
   ```

### 8.3 Docker Build Failure

**Problem**: Build failure when executing `docker build`

**Solution**:

1. Check if Docker is correctly installed and running
2. Check if Dockerfile has syntax errors
3. Ensure the JAR file path is correct
4. Try rebuilding with `--no-cache` parameter:
   ```bash
